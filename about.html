    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        NeurOptim is a research initiative exploring how <strong>Neuromorphic Computing</strong> and <strong>Computational Intelligence</strong> can give rise to a new class of <strong>Optimisation Algorithms</strong>. We study spiking-based approaches that offer the potential for greater energy efficiency, scalability, and responsiveness in solving complex optimisation problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a group, we focus on understanding how optimisation can emerge from event-driven computation; for example, how solutions are represented, how they evolve through spikes, and how neuromorphic systems might support algorithmic behaviours that extend beyond those achievable on traditional digital architectures. We aim to clarify the principles that define neuromorphic optimisation and to contribute open concepts and resources that help shape this developing research area.
    </p>
    <p>
        NeurOptim is committed to open science. We value transparent methodologies, reproducible experimentation, and openly accessible artefacts that support collective progress. Our initiative is designed to be collaborative and outward-facing, and we welcome researchers, students, and practitioners who share an interest in neuromorphic systems, optimisation, or computational intelligence. Whether you wish to explore our material, engage in discussions, test emerging ideas, or participate in community efforts, you are invited to connect with us and contribute to the development of this new optimisation paradigm.
