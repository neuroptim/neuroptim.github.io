A session examining neuromorphic approaches to optimisation and learning, with emphasis on spike-based models, event-driven computation, and algorithm-hardware integration for low-power, scalable problem solving.

## Scope

This session focuses on neuromorphic methods for optimisation and learning. It examines spike-driven models, event-based computation, and the algorithmic structures that can be embedded within neuromorphic substrates. Contributions may address the design of neuromorphic heuristics, integration of optimisation mechanisms with spiking neural dynamics, hardware-algorithm co-design, and the deployment of neuromorphic systems for low-power or real-time applications. The session aims to consolidate recent advances and provide a platform for discussing emerging models, experimental results, and practical considerations for neuromorphic optimisation and learning.
